⚠️⚠️⚠️ This is a WIP ⚠️⚠️⚠️
------

This crate implements the registers of the [ARM PrimeCell UART (PL011)](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0183/g) peripheral using [bitstuff](https://github.com/HayleyDeckers/bitstuff)
It doesn't implement the full peripheral, just the registers. Making it easier to write your own drivers :)
